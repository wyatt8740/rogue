URW Bookman was taken from the PostScript Type 1 fonts present in GhostPDL 9.06,
in the directory `gs/Resource/Font.` 9.06 was licensed under the GNU GPL
version 3.

The Type 1 font was converted by me using FontForge into TrueType and WOFF
formats. My version has one change: all ligatures have been removed in the
interest of legibility.
