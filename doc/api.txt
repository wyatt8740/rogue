This is not intended to be all-inclusive, but just a brief run-down on some
commonly used functions in my code.

write(string):  Clear the main text output and write `string` to it.
append(string): Append `string` to the existing text on the main output.

shellWrite():   Append `string` to the existing text in the built-in javascript
                shell.
