	Created changelog.
	Making buttons usable, part 1.

	Buttons now have an array of objects in the javascript code; these objects
	have getters and setters to alter the values of the buttons.
	For example:
	`button[0].visible = true;`
	will enable button 0,
	`button[0].label = "BLAARGH";`
	will make the text on button 0 "BLAARGH".

	Button objects also have a 'func' property, which is the function they are
	supposed to call at a given time, represented as a string.
	Yeah, this will use `eval()`. If you don't like it, tell me a better way! I've
	done a request for comment and gotten no replies so I think that I'm gonna
	do it this way unless I do get a reply on a better way that is still flexible.

	Note that currently the eval() stuff is not implemented. That'll be soon.

	Also added a slider in settings for the page margins for mobile users with
	rounded screen corners. Currently this does not save persistently.

	Removed some older functions that aren't needed anymore with the new system.

	Changed CSS metrics for the sidebar to a fixed pixel width.
